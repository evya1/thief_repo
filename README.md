# P2P Thief Peer

> **Status — `production-fixes`:** the local game, Thief strategy, FastMCP transport,
> Commit-Reveal audit, orchestration/recovery, OpenRouter wording provider, Gmail reporting path,
> league-kit projection, headless Replay verifier, and repository-integrated Replay GUI are
> implemented and tested. The screenshot below is from a genuine local six-sub-game smoke run;
> it is not a counted league result. External matches, real-time Live GUI binding, confirmed team
> metadata, official course inputs, and the final `v1.0-submission` tag remain explicit gates in
> [`docs/TODO.md`](docs/TODO.md).

This repository implements the autonomous Thief side of a two-peer Police/Thief system. It owns only its local truth and communicates with the sibling peer through FastMCP/MCP. The shared intent is in `docs/PRD.md`; the role-specific strategy is in `docs/PLAN.md`; execution state lives in `docs/TODO.md` and individual task files.

## Project overview

The target is a decentralized hidden-state pursuit game: the Thief process maintains local state, opponent belief, scent evidence, a separate strategy, Commit-Reveal integrity, Live GUI, Replay, resilience, and signed reporting. Its strategy objective is to evade through local belief, preserve escape routes, and answer capture claims truthfully.

## Source-of-truth order

1. Official project specification and official software-quality guide.
2. Repository-local canonical requirements, open items, and traceability in `docs/spec/`, plus authoritative input status in `docs/inputs/INPUT_REGISTER.md`.
3. `docs/PRD.md` for intent and required behavior.
4. `docs/PLAN.md` for this repository's technical strategy.
5. `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/tasks/T###-*.md` for execution state and evidence.

Conflicts stop work and go to the orchestrator. Workers do not silently update the PRD, PLAN, task dependencies, or scope.

## Architecture

The architecture separates domain rules, scent/belief, thief strategy, orchestration/state, FastMCP transport, integrity/audit, reliability, reporting, and GUI/Replay, exposing business behavior through one thin programmatic facade. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the boundaries and the target tree; a path in that tree is not an implementation-status claim.

Implemented on this branch: shared domain/configuration and symmetric transport under `common/`;
the Thief policy under `src/thief_peer/strategy/`; FastMCP, Commit-Reveal, orchestration and
recovery; internal and league-kit artifact projection; the Gmail/OpenRouter paths behind the
central `ExternalApiGatekeeper`; the headless verifier; and the Tk Replay GUI adapter in
`src/thief_peer/replay_gui.py`. The remaining GUI gap is live event binding during a running
network game; replay of sealed repository output is operational today.

## Installation

Prerequisite: a compatible `uv` installation. T002's validated `uv.lock` is committed; use:

```sh
uv sync --locked --all-groups
```

Do not install with `pip`, create a separate `requirements.txt`, or commit a lock outside `uv`'s
own resolution.

## Usage

Minimal CLI example:

```sh
uv run thief-peer --help
```

See [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md) for entry points, options, local and remote examples, mode
behavior, configuration precedence, exit codes, and artifact boundaries.

See [`docs/GMAIL_API.md`](docs/GMAIL_API.md) for the implemented Gmail/email API and wiring status.

See [`docs/reporting/README.md`](docs/reporting/README.md) for the reporting API and artifact flow.

**Replay (verified, works today).** `thief_peer.sdk.verify_replay_bundle(path)` is the sole
public entrypoint; `scripts/replay.py` is a thin CLI over it:

```sh
uv run python scripts/replay.py <bundle-dir>          # human-readable report
uv run python scripts/replay.py <bundle-dir> --json    # machine-readable report
```

Exit codes: `0` verified, `4` illegal, `5` invalid or incomplete, `6` tampered, `2` path/usage
error. A bundle directory has one `manifest_<game_uid>.json`, one `declaration_*`, six
`config_*_g<NN>.json`, six `log_*_g<NN>.json`, and one `result_*.json` — `schema_status:
internal_interop`, `external_authenticity=false`; this is not an official submission schema. See
`docs/evidence/replay/README.md`, `scripts/smoke_replay_integration.py` (produces a bundle from a
real settled series), and `scripts/check_replay_parity.py` (reciprocal cross-repo verification).

The visual facade accepts either a league-kit log or its containing bundle. It verifies both
sealed halves before opening the window; `--verify-only` provides the same check on headless CI:

```sh
uv run python scripts/replay_gui.py artifacts/kit/<game_uid> --verify-only
uv run python scripts/replay_gui.py artifacts/kit/<game_uid>
```

## Configuration

- `config/game.json`: shared, identical, cryptographically locked match contract.
- `config/game.toml`: private role-local choices; it cannot override or weaken a shared value.
- `.env`: local secret-bearing environment only; never commit it.
- `credentials.json` and `token.json`: local Gmail OAuth material; never commit them.
- Optional language-model hint wording is implemented through a provider-neutral boundary and
  the production OpenRouter client. A missing key, timeout, 429, invalid response, or exhausted
  budget falls back to deterministic text without changing the already-selected legal move.

See `config/README.md`. Official reporting templates and the remaining private/team values are still missing and must not be guessed.

## Academic and technical explanation

### Dec-POMDP framing

The two agents act under partial observation: each owns local state and legal transitions in
[`common/domain/rules.py`](common/domain/rules.py), updates an opponent distribution in
[`belief/grid.py`](src/thief_peer/belief/grid.py), and chooses actions through
[`strategy/thief.py`](src/thief_peer/strategy/thief.py). The shared terminal rewards are
implemented in [`common/domain/scoring.py`](common/domain/scoring.py). No strategy receives the
opponent's objective position; only the immutable Replay may display both revealed tracks.

### Discrete pursuit on a bounded graph

There is no external judge: both agents compute the same transition function and terminal conditions from one pre-agreed, byte-identical contract (`config/game.json`, `CFG-001`), so there is no dispute about legality before play starts. One orthogonal step or stay per turn with no diagonal movement (`GAME-004`, `GAME-005`) ties the game to the cops-and-robbers pursuit family studied in graph theory. The board's minimum size of 7×7 (`GAME-001`) keeps the joint state space — the product of both agents' positions and every barrier layout — large enough that brute-force search over it is not a viable strategy, which is why heuristic and learned policies (`STRAT-007`) are the intended approach rather than exhaustive enumeration. The barrier quota (`GAME-008`) makes Police a spatial-resource manager: barriers must squeeze the Thief without accidentally cutting off Police's own reachable cells, since a placed barrier is irreversible for the rest of the game (`GAME-007`).

Scoring is asymmetric by design, not a binary win/lose: every terminal outcome pays both sides differently, and a technical loss zeros both sides regardless of position (`GAME-013`) — so protocol correctness is worth more than winning on the clock alone. `docs/decisions/ADR-001-shared-game-contract-shape.md` records the negotiated (non-official) shape of the contract file that carries these values, and `docs/spec/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` OPEN-011 tracks the one unresolved ambiguity in the terminal-condition rules (whether the move cap and survival threshold are one event or two).

### FastMCP and orchestration dilemmas

The implemented peers expose the symmetric MCP surface in
[`mcp_server.py`](common/transport/mcp_server.py), call it through
[`mcp_client.py`](common/transport/mcp_client.py), and preserve deadlines/recovery in the runner
and transport state machine. Public URLs are operator-supplied metadata—the CLI never pretends to
create a tunnel. Local HTTP, two-process, fault, and reference-kit tests are automated; counted
public-endpoint evidence remains a live gate.

### Implemented strategy

The shipped `ThiefBrain` is deterministic, not reinforcement learning. It resolves the threat
from a confident belief peak, then scent, then board centre. The pure scoring policy ranks every
legal move by distance, mobility, freshness, and trap risk, with a hard exclusion for a confident
threat cell; the Thief never places barriers.

### Live GUI evidence

The Replay GUI includes the same belief-heatmap board component, but its current repository
adapter consumes sealed post-game artifacts. It is not presented as real-time Live GUI evidence;
binding the live event stream without exposing objective opponent state remains tracked by T014.

### Replay evidence

![Thief Replay GUI showing both revealed tracks and verified commitments](docs/assets/replay-gui-verified.png)

This screenshot was captured from the actual Tk application after
`scripts/smoke_replay_integration.py` produced a settled local series. The adapter re-hashed both
sealed halves before opening; the step panel shows `Verified OK — both sealed halves` and the status shows
`audit: PASSED`. The committed image is unedited application output, not a fabricated league
result.

## Testing and quality gates

Local and CI checks use the same three command groups:

```sh
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
uv run python scripts/run_quality_gates.py
```

The quality configuration enforces Ruff zero, 85% global coverage, required docs, task-ID/TODO
consistency, local Markdown links, secret/archive protection, and least-privilege workflow
permissions. The 150-logical-line cap now scans `src/` and `common/` as well as `tests/` and
`scripts/` (T040 repaired the earlier `source_dirs = []` blind spot); a small pinned
`[line_cap_baseline]` ratchet in `config/repo_quality.toml` names the historical files still over
the cap — no new file may join that list, and each entry must exactly match the file's current
line count.

Verification proceeds as a ladder — deterministic unit and golden-vector tests, a local two-process protocol smoke test, a full practice series, artifact validation, network readiness, an uncounted external game, and only then a counted game. The stages, their owning tasks, and their gates are recorded in `docs/PLAN.md`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Task cannot start:** inspect `depends_on` in its task file and the status of each prerequisite in `docs/TODO.md`.
- **Contract/config mismatch:** stop before Step 0; compare only the approved shared terms and record the exact mismatch without secrets.
- **Request timeout:** retain the original deadline, apply bounded configured retry, and preserve failure evidence.
- **Audit mismatch:** do not repair history; preserve the received commitment and revealed record and follow the TAMPERED path.
- **Gmail/OAuth issue:** do not broaden scopes or commit credential files; use mocks until the human live-send gate.
- **Optional provider timeout, 429, or budget limit:** preserve the already selected legal move, fall back to deterministic template text, and never make a live provider call from CI.
- **Headless Replay GUI:** use `--verify-only`; for visual CI evidence, run the same command under
  Xvfb. Tk 8.6 was used for the screenshot above.

Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `AGENTS.md`. Claim exactly one ready task, use its write set, run its verification, and hand off structured evidence. GitHub Issues and Pull Requests assist review but never replace the Markdown task graph.

## License and credits

No repository-wide open-source license is asserted. The team-supplied course Replay Viewer was
used locally to study the expected kit-log presentation, but its restrictively licensed source
is not redistributed in this public repository. The checked-in facade is repository-native and
uses this project's canonical verifier and artifacts.
