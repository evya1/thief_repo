# P2P Thief Peer

> **Status:** early implementation. Core board/movement/barrier/capture/scoring logic exists in `common/domain/` with a passing local test suite; FastMCP transport, strategy, integrity, reporting, and GUI layers are not yet implemented. No screenshots, benchmarks, league results, or end-to-end application-test evidence exists yet.

This repository will implement the autonomous Thief side of a two-peer Police/Thief system. It owns only its local truth and communicates with the sibling peer through FastMCP/MCP. The shared intent is in `docs/PRD.md`; the role-specific strategy is in `docs/PLAN.md`; execution state lives in `docs/TODO.md` and individual task files.

## Project overview

The target is a decentralized hidden-state pursuit game: the Thief process maintains local state, opponent belief, scent evidence, a separate strategy, Commit-Reveal integrity, Live GUI, Replay, resilience, and signed reporting. Its strategy objective is to evade through local belief, preserve escape routes, and answer capture claims truthfully.

## Source-of-truth order

1. Official project specification and official software-quality guide.
2. Repository-local canonical requirements, open items, and traceability in `docs/spec/`, plus authoritative input status in `docs/inputs/INPUT_REGISTER.md`.
3. `docs/PRD.md` for intent and required behavior.
4. `docs/PLAN.md` for this repository's technical strategy.
5. `docs/TODO.md` and `docs/tasks/T###-*.md` for execution state and evidence.

Conflicts stop work and go to the orchestrator. Workers do not silently update the PRD, PLAN, task dependencies, or scope.

## Architecture

The proposed architecture separates domain rules, scent/belief, thief strategy, orchestration/state, FastMCP transport, integrity/audit, reliability, reporting, and GUI/Replay. It exposes business behavior through one thin programmatic facade. See `docs/PLAN.md` for boundaries and the proposed tree; those paths are not implementation-status claims.

## Installation

Prerequisite: a compatible `uv` installation.

```sh
uv sync --all-groups
```

`TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: T002 must approve runtime dependency versions and commit a validated `uv.lock`; after that, use:

```sh
uv sync --locked --all-groups
```

Do not install with `pip`, create a separate `requirements.txt`, or commit a provisional lock generated before T002 approval.

## Usage

`TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: document the exact launcher, FastMCP endpoint, tunnel setup, warm-up/counted modes, GUI start, Replay command, controlled shutdown, and expected output only after those interfaces exist and have been verified.

Planned programmatic entry: `thief_peer.sdk` (final public names are owned by T003).

## Configuration

- `config/game.json`: shared, identical, cryptographically locked match contract.
- `config/game.toml`: private role-local choices; it cannot override or weaken a shared value.
- `.env`: local secret-bearing environment only; never commit it.
- `credentials.json` and `token.json`: local Gmail OAuth material; never commit them.
- Optional language-model provider: T027 may implement a provider-neutral adapter only after PLANQ-003/PLANQ-004 approval. Template mode remains valid without a provider; any selected external provider uses the Gatekeeper and local secret configuration, with no credential variable predefined before selection.

See `config/README.md`. Official reporting templates and the remaining private/team values are still missing and must not be guessed.

## Academic and technical explanation

### Dec-POMDP framing

The two agents act under partial observation: each knows its own position and locally known state, observes opponent scent and natural-language hints, maintains a belief distribution, and selects an action without a central judge. Rewards follow the fixed capture/survival/tie rules. `TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: relate the implemented state, observation, action, transition, and reward code to this framing with precise file links.

### Discrete pursuit on a bounded graph

There is no external judge: both agents compute the same transition function and terminal conditions from one pre-agreed, byte-identical contract (`config/game.json`, `CFG-001`), so there is no dispute about legality before play starts. One orthogonal step or stay per turn with no diagonal movement (`GAME-004`, `GAME-005`) ties the game to the cops-and-robbers pursuit family studied in graph theory. The board's minimum size of 7×7 (`GAME-001`) keeps the joint state space — the product of both agents' positions and every barrier layout — large enough that brute-force search over it is not a viable strategy, which is why heuristic and learned policies (`STRAT-007`) are the intended approach rather than exhaustive enumeration. The barrier quota (`GAME-008`) makes Police a spatial-resource manager: barriers must squeeze the Thief without accidentally cutting off Police's own reachable cells, since a placed barrier is irreversible for the rest of the game (`GAME-007`).

Scoring is asymmetric by design, not a binary win/lose: every terminal outcome pays both sides differently, and a technical loss zeros both sides regardless of position (`GAME-013`) — so protocol correctness is worth more than winning on the clock alone. `docs/decisions/ADR-001-shared-game-contract-shape.md` records the negotiated (non-official) shape of the contract file that carries these values, and `docs/spec/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` OPEN-011 tracks the one unresolved ambiguity in the terminal-condition rules (whether the move cap and survival threshold are one event or two).

### FastMCP and orchestration dilemmas

The planned solution uses symmetric server/client peers, an explicit lifecycle state machine, immutable request deadlines, bounded retry, and audit evidence. `TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: document the implemented tool surface, public-connectivity procedure, failure handling, and measured interoperability evidence after OPEN-001/OPEN-007 are resolved.

### Implemented strategy

`TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: describe only the Thief strategy actually implemented and tested. Do not claim reinforcement learning. Add learning curves only if RL is genuinely used and its experiment is reproducible.

### Live GUI evidence

`TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: insert a real screenshot showing local truth and the opponent-belief heatmap without revealing objective opponent position.

### Replay evidence

`TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: insert a real Replay screenshot showing per-step `Verified OK` from a verified final log. Never manufacture a screenshot or edit a status into one.

## Testing and quality gates

Local and CI checks use the same three command groups:

```sh
uv run ruff check .
uv run pytest
uv run python scripts/run_quality_gates.py
```

The quality configuration enforces Ruff zero, 85% global coverage, a 150 logical-code-line limit, required docs, task-ID/TODO consistency, local Markdown links, secret/archive protection, and least-privilege workflow permissions. The coverage gate currently measures `scripts/`; it extends to `src/` and `common/` as component tasks land tests there.

## Troubleshooting

- **Task cannot start:** inspect `depends_on` in its task file and the status of each prerequisite in `docs/TODO.md`.
- **Contract/config mismatch:** stop before Step 0; compare only the approved shared terms and record the exact mismatch without secrets.
- **Request timeout:** retain the original deadline, apply bounded configured retry, and preserve failure evidence.
- **Audit mismatch:** do not repair history; preserve the received commitment and revealed record and follow the TAMPERED path.
- **Gmail/OAuth issue:** do not broaden scopes or commit credential files; use mocks until the human live-send gate.
- **Optional provider timeout, 429, or budget limit:** preserve the already selected legal move, fall back to deterministic template text, and never make a live provider call from CI.
- `TODO_BEFORE_SUBMISSION`: add observed platform-specific failures and verified remedies.
