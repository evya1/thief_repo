"""Inject the hazards SPEC section 7.1 describes, deterministically.

A receiver contract tested only against a calm transport has not been tested. These are not
exotic conditions: a client that retries an in-game push on the turn budget — the behaviour that
stops a network flap from costing you the game — **is a duplicate sender by design**.

The flagship test uses this to run the same seeded six-sub-game series twice, once clean and once
with duplicates, reordering and dropped-then-retried messages, and asserts the outcome ledger is
byte-identical. That is the receiver contract proven at the level teams actually care about: not
"we handled a duplicate" but "the duplicates changed nothing about who won".
