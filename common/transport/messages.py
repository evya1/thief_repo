"""The four message shapes of ``wire_shape: reference-v3``.

Nulls are emitted explicitly rather than omitted, matching the reference's own
wire. A receiver should tolerate either — SPEC's stance everywhere is that
unknown keys pass and absent optional keys are silence — but a *sender* that
matches the common shape gives the other side less to guess about on a first
meeting.
