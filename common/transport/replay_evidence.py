"""Frozen per-subgame replay evidence (RP-06, OBS-006, SEC-005, SEC-006).

``capture_subgame_evidence`` is an *observation* of values a finished sub-game already
produced — the step-0-prefixed audit record list just sent, the opponent's revealed
records, and the opponent-commitment ledger already consumed by the live audit. It adds
no state machine and changes no message, audit, or settlement order. Opponent-supplied
records are decoded defensively (a hostile peer must never crash a legal game); our own
records are ours and are decoded the same defensive way as a matter of course.
