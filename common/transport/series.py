"""End-to-end series engine over a PeerChannel.

The top of the tree: a full six-sub-game series that drives handshake, strict
thief-first alternation, at-least-once turn delivery, and a real three-layer mutual
audit over any PeerChannel (loopback for CI, FastMCP for production). The engine is
role-agnostic: it takes the natural role and the channel and derives the per-sub-game
role via ``role_for``. A failed audit settles the sub-game ``TAMPER_FORFEIT`` — both
sides zeroed, no repair path (FR-29). The per-sub-game turn loop lives in
``subgame.py`` (150-logical-line cap).
