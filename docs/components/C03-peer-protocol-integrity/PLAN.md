# C03 — Peer Protocol & Integrity (Thief PLAN)

## Approach summary

`src/thief_peer/transport/` implements symmetric FastMCP server/client adapters and the inbound-delivery-safety hardening (TD-04). `src/thief_peer/integrity/` implements the single Commit-Reveal/audit path (M-05) against the internal draft canonicalization (CT-04) until OPEN-007 resolves.

## Internal design

- `transport/mcp_server.py`, `transport/mcp_client.py` — symmetric FastMCP roles (NET-001).
- `transport/contracts.py` — the negotiated, versioned envelope shape (M-06) and the `reference-v3` profile surface recorded in CT-03: the four tool names with their argument-name asymmetry, the required turn-message keys including `smell_grid`, the four locked-model declarations carried as document hashes outside the closed signed-terms set, and the thief-first turn-order convention. Explicitly labeled non-official pending OPEN-001/OPEN-007; it is a profile behind the adapter boundary, not an official schema.
- `transport/inbox.py` — bounded at-least-once receive safety: absorb exact duplicates, quarantine conflicting duplicates, buffer a configured reorder window, reopen one dropped session within the original deadline (TD-04, derived hardening — not itself an official wire requirement).
- `integrity/commit_reveal.py`, `integrity/audit.py` — the M-05 algorithm: Commit → Acknowledge → Reveal → Final Reveal/Audit, one canonical hashing implementation, TAMPERED with no repair.

## State/responsibility ownership

Transport owns the wire and receive-safety state; integrity owns commitment/audit state and is the only place that computes a canonical hash. Neither owns game decisions.

## Local test strategy

FastMCP contract tests against the local envelope shape and the `reference-v3` surface, including an assertion of the `payload`/`message` argument asymmetry and of turn-order behavior; two-process `localhost` smoke test with no opponent URL (`tests/integration/test_two_process_smoke.py`); nonce/tamper/replay/physics audit tests; the published golden vectors for the canonical-byte and commit primitives this component owns, run here rather than deferred to T022; the compatibility decision matrix from M-05/CT-04 exercised as differential tests only, never selecting a production default for the *official* envelope before OPEN-007.

## Component-level integration

`planning/INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`'s `local_mcp_smoke` gate is this component's first cross-component proof, entirely local. `cross_peer_vectors` stays gated by OPEN-007 until it resolves; `public_endpoint` stays gated by `G-LIVE`.

## Known risks

A local draft canonicalization (CT-04) accidentally treated as production-ready before OPEN-007 resolves — mitigated by the explicit non-official label and the compatibility-matrix pattern. Reproducing a published peer's vectors being read as evidence that OPEN-007 is answered — mitigated by ADR-004's authority boundary, which separates "our bytes match a known peer" from "our bytes are the officially required bytes". Retry/duplicate logic producing forked state — mitigated by the idempotent receipt journal.
