# ADR-004 — Operational Interoperability Profile

Use an ADR only for a sufficiently important and durable technical design decision. Official-input receipt belongs in the Input Register, product/requirement changes belong in a Change Request, and execution work belongs in a task. This decision selects a runtime interoperability profile; it adds, removes, and normatively changes no canonical requirement, so no Change Request applies. Tracked by GitHub Issue #6.

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Independent Police and Thief peers must compute byte-identical scent arithmetic and speak an identical wire shape, or they diverge silently with no error either side can detect alone. The canonical requirements fix the scent parameters (`CFG-006`: centre `0.9`, decay `0.10`, 5×5 field) and the recurrence (`STRAT-003`), but leave the repeated-emission/saturation, merge, and update-order behaviour unstated — that is `OPEN-009`, and no official artifact or written lecturer clarification has answered it.

Waiting for an official answer before selecting any implementation behavior blocks development indefinitely on an input the project does not control. The project needs one concrete, deterministic profile that both peers can implement and test against now, while keeping the official question open and revisable.

## Decision

Adopt one default interoperability profile and one additional supported scent profile.

**Default profile:**

| Axis | Value |
|---|---|
| `wire_shape` | `reference-v3` |
| `scent_model` | `subtractive_chebyshev_v1` |
| `info_mode` | `belief` |
| `smell_binding` | current/unbound behaviour; the `commit_grid_v1` extension is **not** adopted |
| turn order | Thief takes the first game turn |

The required `smell_grid` turn-message key is preserved, because `reference-v3` transmits the field rather than recomputing it.

The turn-order convention is load-bearing and is recorded explicitly because the `wire_shape` declaration does not cover it: two peers whose locks all match can still each wait for the other forever after a fully successful handshake. In this repository's natural Thief role, that means our peer opens the game rather than waiting for the opponent's first turn.

**Additionally supported scent profile:** `multiplicative_book_v1`, the explicit book-oriented alternative. It is implemented, vector-tested, and selectable. It is not deleted, downgraded, or folded into the default merely because it is not the default.

The full arithmetic of both profiles is recorded once, in `docs/mechanisms/M-01-scent-model.md` §B; the full wire surface is recorded once, in `docs/contracts/CT-03-peer-wire.md`. This ADR does not restate either.

## Operational conventions

Every value in the Decision section above is an **operational convention**: a project decision for deterministic execution, not an official requirement.

- This decision does **not** close `OPEN-009`. `official_status` for `OPEN-009` remains `OPEN`.
- It is **not** a lecturer clarification or an official resolution of section 4.3. No project artifact may state that this decision resolves OPEN-009, that a lecturer clarified it, or that the official model is subtractive.
- It does **not** override the project book or the official software-quality guide. The source authority order is unchanged: official sources first, canonical requirements second, this operational convention third.
- Neither profile in `M-01` §B may be described as the officially correct reading. `multiplicative_book_v1` is the closest reading of the printed figure, but its upper clamp, evaluation order, and no-rounding policy are still interpretation.
- A future official clarification can require a profile change. That is expected and inexpensive by construction, which is the point of keeping the selection behind an interface.
- `smell_binding: commit_grid_v1` is deliberately excluded from the approved profile because it
  changes the commitment preimage.

What `OPEN-009` no longer does is block implementation. Scent implementation, default-model selection, model-lock generation and declaration, and local testing all proceed against this profile. Confirmation against an official answer happens before counted play.

The same principle applies generally: where an operational convention supplies enough information to implement, an unresolved official ambiguity narrows to the claim of official correctness rather than blocking the build.

## Alternatives considered

- **`multiplicative_book_v1` as the only or default profile.** Rejected as the *default*, not as a profile — it stays fully supported. As a default it maximises apparent fidelity to the printed figure while minimising interoperability: it is not what `reference-v3` carries, and each side would have to recompute rather than transmit the field. It also would not actually settle `OPEN-009`, since its upper clamp and evaluation order are themselves interpretation.
- **A single scent profile, dropping `multiplicative_book_v1`.** Rejected: it discards the reading closest to the printed source. If an official clarification later favours the book's arithmetic, the project would have to rebuild it from nothing, and the interoperability argument for the reference profile would not survive that clarification.
- **Continue selecting nothing until `OPEN-009` is officially answered.** Rejected: it blocks `T005`, and through it belief and strategy, on an external answer with no committed date, while a sufficient basis to build already exists. It also leaves the model-lock behaviour (`STRAT-005`) untested until very late, which is precisely the kind of interoperability defect that is cheapest to find early.
- **Support both models, with `subtractive_chebyshev_v1` as the default — SELECTED.** Keeps the book reading implemented and testable, gives both peers one deterministic default to build and test against immediately, and turns the unresolved ambiguity into a declared, checkable runtime choice instead of a silent assumption.

## Consequences

- Two scent implementations exist behind one small common interface. Belief and strategy consume the selected profile through that boundary and never branch on which model is active.
- Model selection is an explicit runtime/profile configuration value, read through the existing local private-configuration seam owned by `T003`. It is not an Appendix F term, is not a secret, and never weakens a signed shared value. No change to `T003` is required.
- The selected model is declared as a hash over a pinned parameter document, alongside the wire, info-mode, and smell-binding declarations, and outside the closed signed-terms set. A mismatch refuses the start with a diagnostic and no partial game state; a peer that declares nothing is not a mismatch.
- Vector/golden tests cover **both** registered models, plus repeated-emission/saturation, edges, corners, and clipping.
- Deterministic peer agreement: both peers can compute identical scent and wire behavior from this document alone, without an external negotiation round-trip.
- `T005`'s scope grows slightly — a second model and a selection seam — but stays one bounded task. It is not split, and it is not renumbered.
- `T009` gains a concrete, locally provable wire target instead of an invented envelope. `T008` gains a fixed set of primitives to golden-test early rather than deferring every byte check to `T022`.
- This ADR is limited to protocol-level interoperability. Gameplay policy, heuristics, search behaviour, and strategy design remain independent; compatibility is implemented through local adapters, profile definitions, and conformance tests.
- Negative: two arithmetic implementations to maintain, and a declared profile that must stay consistent between our configuration, our lock document, and our documentation. Mitigated by both models being pinned to vector tests, so drift fails a test rather than a match.

## Revisit conditions

Revisit this decision if any of the following occurs:

- The lecturer supplies an official clarification of the section 4.3 saturation/merge/update-order question.
- An official artifact pins bytes or semantics incompatible with the adopted profile.
- A counted opponent requires a mutually agreed alternative profile.

In each case the profile changes; the canonical requirements do not.

## Validation

- `scripts/check_planning_graph.py` passes: 29 tasks, 6 components, dependency graph unchanged and acyclic.
- `scripts/run_quality_gates.py` passes, including link and secret checks.
- Every shared artifact touched by this decision remains byte-identical in both role repositories.
- `docs/spec/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` still records `OPEN-009` with `official_status: OPEN`.
- No application source, no `uv.lock`, and no runtime dependency change accompanies this decision.
