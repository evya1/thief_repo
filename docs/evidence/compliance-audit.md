## Submission integrity

- Canonical game artifact: [`game.json`](games/ZeroOne0-vs-bestteam/game.json), SHA-256 `a701b8db8adabf3227a6c2c340a04246f46b25fab1f3c018ceb4d9b75dffe1da`.
- Counted game `ZeroOne0-vs-bestteam`, UID `a42b2bb2-2312-c679-5e69-fa3d5ea0aad9`, is settled with `audit_ok: true` in all six subgames.
- Live and Replay screenshots decode at 970×690 and are linked from the README.
- All 23 generated OpenRouter model/provider hyperlinks returned HTTP 200; all 15 committed provider assets decode locally.
- OpenRouter request counts, token counts, costs, percentages, and provider memberships are unchanged by the presentation mapping.
- The Opus 4.8 row records a $159.56 standard list-price equivalent using Anthropic's default five-minute cache rates; Claude Code accounted spend reconciles to $410.76 and combined accounted spend to $451.634392.
- The private OpenRouter input remains outside the repository.
- Superseded question IDs and stale group codes are absent from tracked submission content.
- [`LICENSE`](../../LICENSE) matches the required Educational Use EULA, SHA-256 `b8f5904d8625f22f18f3d6217b4cf066bf3c921fe895fcb8a324b690a63f8a06`.

## AI usage block

The checksum before the Opus 4.8 cost update was `b38d0f1ab6cb41b80f2402b5a941f00ae4bf138b33dddb2a50fc145b26a1a5d8`; the checksum after regeneration is `a3d4de51d60864461b92aae9872772ec08ca80ef70edf8aa58319e259e9313f1`. The authorized numerical change adds the Opus 4.8 list-price equivalent and reconciles the Claude Code and combined totals; OpenRouter values and memberships remain unchanged.
