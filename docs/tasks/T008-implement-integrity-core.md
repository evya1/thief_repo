# T008 — Implement Integrity Core

## Expected outcome

A single integrity boundary creates fresh nonces, performs SHA-256 Commit-Reveal, retains received commitments, and verifies complete reveals without ambiguous parallel hash paths.

## Requirements implemented

- `SEC-001`
- `SEC-002`
- `SEC-003`
- `SEC-004`
- `SEC-005`
- `SEC-006`
- `SEC-007`

## Relevant context

The minimum committed semantics are State, Move, Intent, and Nonce. OPEN-007 blocks the final *official* byte envelope, including nonce placement, Unicode escaping, separators, and report-consensus scope, and it stays open. Auxiliary serializers and vectors are not official schema evidence and never become one.

Two different claims must not be confused. "Our bytes are the officially required bytes" waits on OPEN-007. "Our bytes reproduce our own registered, golden-vector-tested primitives" does not — it is a checkable property of the primitives this task builds. Under the operational convention recorded in `ADR-004`, this task proves the second claim now rather than deferring every byte check to T022. Proving it changes nothing about OPEN-007's official status.

This task does **not** own scent arithmetic. Scent profiles and their vectors belong to T005.

## Gates

- `OPEN-007` (`open`, `blocks: criterion`) — the task may be claimed and implemented now; only the acceptance criterion scoped `cross_peer_vectors`, which concerns the official envelope, waits. The early golden-vector criterion below is not gated by it.

## Constraints

- Do not edit the canonical PRD.
- Do not silently redefine the repository PLAN or task dependencies.
- Do not widen scope or treat a derived design decision as a source requirement.
- Edit only the declared write set; request an orchestrator-approved change before crossing it.
- Escalate requirement conflicts, missing official inputs, and newly discovered work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every step uses a fresh cryptographic nonce that is never transmitted before final reveal.
- [ ] Commit, acknowledgement, reveal, and final audit ordering is explicit.
- [ ] Audit compares reveals to commitments retained from live play, detects missing/extra/mutated steps, and checks legal state progression.
- [ ] One hash mismatch yields an immutable TAMPERED result and no repair path.
- [ ] The canonical-serialization and commit primitives this task owns reproduce the published golden vectors for those primitives byte-for-byte, run as part of this task's own suite: canonical JSON (sorted keys, non-escaped non-ASCII, compact separators, UTF-8), the commit construction over a canonical payload with a single-pipe nonce separator, and the same construction applied to the terms/uid signatures built on it. A float that fails shortest round-trip representation must fail this suite here, not at an opponent's audit. `{#early_byte_vectors}`
- [ ] Differential fixtures cover compact/spaced JSON, Nonce inside/appended, Unicode, floats, key order, signature insertion, replay, step order, and Nonce tampering; only the OPEN-007-approved form is enabled for production. `{#cross_peer_vectors}`

## Verification

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/integrity tests/contract/test_commit_reveal.py`
- `uv run ruff check src/thief_peer/integrity tests/unit/integrity tests/contract/test_commit_reveal.py`

## Implementation plan

To be completed immediately before execution.

## Handoff contract

Report files changed, tests executed, exact test results, decisions made, deviations, blockers, and newly discovered work. Include command output or artifact paths sufficient for the orchestrator to validate every acceptance criterion.
