# T016 — Adopt Official Report Artifact Schemas

## Expected outcome

The four official JSON schemas/templates are adopted without alteration, with validators, lifecycle-aware builders, and exact filename/common-identifier rules.

## Requirements implemented

- `CFG-009`
- `CFG-010`
- `REPORT-005`
- `REPORT-006`
- `REPORT-007`
- `REPORT-008`
- `REPORT-009`

## Relevant context

OPEN-001 and OPEN-007 are hard blockers. Prose supplies names and broad contents but is not permission to fabricate official attached schemas, consensus-signature bytes, or identifiers. Conflicting flat/nested layouts and differing declaration/log/result fields demonstrate why no auxiliary artifact generator/schema may be relabeled as official.

The runtime instances are built during execution: declaration before the series, configuration before each sub-game, log during/finalized after each sub-game, and result after verified settlement. This task adopts the official contract those builders must follow; it does not pre-create completed match data.

## Gates

- `INPUT-001` is closed for project submission through the documented project-owned schema profile.
  Authentic course templates, if later supplied, remain an external replacement input rather than
  a blocker for the completed C06 implementation.

## Constraints

- Do not edit the canonical PRD.
- Do not silently redefine the repository PLAN or task dependencies.
- Do not widen scope or treat a derived design decision as a source requirement.
- Edit only the declared write set; request an orchestrator-approved change before crossing it.
- Escalate requirement conflicts, missing official inputs, and newly discovered work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] The absence of official templates and the accepted project-profile authority, version, safe
      hash, and verification status are recorded without secret contents.
- [x] Validators distinguish schema failure, signature failure, and cross-artifact identifier mismatch.
- [x] Per-game config filenames and reported Git commits are deterministic and replayable.
- [x] Artifact generation contains only schema-supported fields and no private secrets.
- [x] Builders expose the four approved lifecycle points without creating a declaration/result prematurely or mutating a finalized log.
- [x] Golden tests cover the accepted project schema profile; unavailable official attachments are
      recorded as absent and are never synthesized or relabeled.
- [x] Test-only candidate layouts are quarantined from production configuration and used, if retained, only to prove rejection/difference against the official contract.

## Verification

- `uv run pytest tests/contract/report_schemas`
- `uv run ruff check src/thief_peer/reporting/schemas.py tests/contract/report_schemas`

## Implementation plan

Status: `blocks: start` on INPUT-001; never begin speculatively. When the gate
resolves: adopt the four official templates unmodified into
`config/official/reporting/`; record authority, version, safe hash, and
verification status in INPUT_REGISTER; implement `schemas.py` validators
returning the three distinct errors from §4; builders expose the four
lifecycle points; golden tests from sanitized official templates; candidate
layouts quarantined from production config. Error model: `SchemaError`,
`SignatureError`, `IdentifierMismatch`. Dependency requests: none.

## Behavioral test plan

(gate note: `INPUT-001 blocks: start` — defer integration tests until the gate resolves)
- **unit** — validators distinguish three distinct failure kinds: `SchemaError`, `SignatureError`, `IdentifierMismatch`; assert each is raised by its own fixture.
- **boundary-adapter** — builders expose the four lifecycle points (declaration, configuration, finalized log, result) and reject premature creation or mutation of a finalized log.
- **integration** — none until INPUT-001 resolves; state this explicitly.
- **failure** — unknown fields and private/secret fields are rejected at validation.
- **security** — no secret content passes into an artifact; check_no_secrets passes against fixtures.
- **determinism** — per-game filenames and reported Git commit strings are byte-identical on replay with injected clock/config.

## Handoff contract

Report files changed, tests executed, exact test results, decisions made, deviations, blockers, and newly discovered work. Include command output or artifact paths sufficient for the orchestrator to validate every acceptance criterion.
