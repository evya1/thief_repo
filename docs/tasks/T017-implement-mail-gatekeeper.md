# T017 — Implement External-service Gatekeeper And Gmail Adapter

## Expected outcome

A reusable configuration-driven external-service Gatekeeper provides token bucket, queue, DOS lockout, 429 backoff, and optional quota management; the mandatory send-only Gmail adapter is reachable only through it.

## Requirements implemented

- `SEC-010`
- `REPORT-001`
- `REPORT-002`
- `REPORT-003`
- `REPORT-004`
- `REPORT-010`
- `REPORT-011`
- `REPORT-012`
- `REPORT-013`
- `QR-008`

## Relevant context

Tests must never contact Gmail or any optional model provider. Live OAuth authorization and delivery are human-gated, local credential files remain ignored, and any external call introduced by T027 must pass through this boundary without changing Gmail behavior. A draft-only adapter or pretty-printed JSON body is not a counted-report sender and must fail the compliance test.

## Gates

- `PLANQ-005` (`decision`, `blocks: criterion`) — the task may be claimed and implemented now; only the acceptance criterion scoped `sender_choice` waits.

## Constraints

- Do not edit the canonical PRD.
- Do not silently redefine the repository PLAN or task dependencies.
- Do not widen scope or treat a derived design decision as a source requirement.
- Edit only the declared write set; request an orchestrator-approved change before crossing it.
- Escalate requirement conflicts, missing official inputs, and newly discovered work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] OAuth requests only gmail.send and rejects broader granted scopes.
- [ ] The adapter uses the Gmail send operation and cannot silently substitute draft creation or message-body text for the required JSON attachment, per the approved PLANQ-005 sender selection. `{#sender_choice}`
- [ ] All Gmail sends and any later optional model-provider calls pass through the single Gatekeeper; direct service calls are structurally prevented.
- [ ] Token bucket, concurrency, queue, retry/backoff, DOS lockout, and monitoring use approved configuration.
- [ ] credentials.json and token.json are ignored, never logged, and absent from fixtures.
- [ ] 429, quota, expired-token, invalid-recipient, duplicate-send, and network-error paths use test doubles.

## Verification

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/infra/test_external_api_gatekeeper.py tests/unit/reporting/test_gmail.py`
- `uv run ruff check src/thief_peer/infra/external_api_gatekeeper.py src/thief_peer/reporting/gmail.py tests/unit/infra tests/unit/reporting`
- `uv run python scripts/check_no_secrets.py`

## Implementation plan

Modules `external_api_gatekeeper.py` (facade: token bucket, queue, DOS
lockout, backoff, optional quota) and `reporting/gmail.py` (adapter).
Configuration-driven limits (private TOML defaults, shared JSON overrides).
Gmail adapter builds the RFC 2822 MIME message per §1 and calls
`users().messages().send`; scope check rejects broader grants. Backoff policy
(exact): on HTTP 429 only, exponential backoff with full jitter, base 2.0 s,
max 3 attempts; queue overflow and DOS lockout do not retry. Resource
lifecycle: bounded queue with timeout/cancellation; blocking send executed
off the event loop via an injected executor seam. Error model: `RateLimited`,
`QueueOverflow`, `DosLocked`, `BackoffExceeded`, `QuotaExhausted`,
`InvalidRecipient`, `TokenExpired`, `DuplicateSend`, `NetworkError`.
Dependency request: structured `dependency_request` for
`google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib` (a
separate authorized dependency-integration step must land them before T017
tests run).

## Behavioral test plan

(gate note: `PLANQ-005` resolved by this analysis → `sender_choice` criterion unblocked)
- **unit** — token bucket refills per injected clock and refuses over-capacity; concurrency bound is enforced; queue overflow is explicit; DOS lockout threshold flips the pipeline locked; quota decrement reaches zero.
- **boundary-adapter (Gmail)** — a fake send seam captures the exact `raw` bytes; an OAuth scope check rejects any broader granted scope; a draft-substitute or message-body-text path fails the compliance check.
- **integration** — Gatekeeper + Gmail adapter are wired so every send transits the single facade; a future provider adapter must route through the same facade without changing Gmail behavior.
- **failure** — 429 (backoff, not blind retry), quota-exhausted, expired-token, invalid-recipient, duplicate-send, and network-error paths each return a distinct failure outcome.
- **security** — credentials.json/token.json are absent from fixtures and logs; check_no_secrets passes.
- **determinism** — backoff schedule and bucket state are deterministic under an injected clock/RNG.

## Handoff contract

Report files changed, tests executed, exact test results, decisions made, deviations, blockers, and newly discovered work. Include command output or artifact paths sufficient for the orchestrator to validate every acceptance criterion.
