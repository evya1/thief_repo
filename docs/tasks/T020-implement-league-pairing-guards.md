# T020 — Implement League Pairing Guards

## Expected outcome

Preflight guards enforce counted-match eligibility and truthful declarations, while preserving auditable evidence for computational fairness.

## Requirements implemented

- `LEAGUE-002`
- `LEAGUE-003`
- `LEAGUE-004`
- `LEAGUE-007`

## Relevant context

The system reports required inputs but never invents lecturer-side normalization. Warm-ups remain explicitly non-counted.

## Gates

- `G-LIVE` (`input_gate`, `blocks: criterion`) — the task may be claimed and implemented now; only the acceptance criterion scoped `pairing_preflight` waits.

## Constraints

- Do not edit the canonical PRD.
- Do not silently redefine the repository PLAN or task dependencies.
- Do not widen scope or treat a derived design decision as a source requirement.
- Edit only the declared write set; request an orchestrator-approved change before crossing it.
- Escalate requirement conflicts, missing official inputs, and newly discovered work.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] The peer refuses an eleventh counted match or a second counted match with the same opponent.
- [ ] At least two distinct opponents is tracked as a submission obligation, not faked before completion.
- [ ] Prior counted-match declarations are signed, compared, and retained.
- [ ] Warm-up and counted modes are unambiguous and cannot share report state accidentally.
- [ ] Hardware/code/token evidence is complete but contains no local fairness score formula.
- [ ] Preflight eligibility, declaration, and endpoint checks pass against real opponent/endpoint data once `G-LIVE` is satisfied. `{#pairing_preflight}`

## Verification

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/league/test_pairing_guards.py tests/integration/test_preflight.py`
- `uv run ruff check src/thief_peer/league/preflight.py tests/unit/league/test_pairing_guards.py tests/integration/test_preflight.py`

## Implementation plan

`preflight.py` provides pure guards over opponent history and signed
declarations: enforce 2..10 counted matches total (LEAGUE-002), at most one
counted match per opponent (LEAGUE-003), truthful prior-count declarations
signed/compared/retained (LEAGUE-004), warm-up/counted mode separation, and
hardware/version/token evidence collection with **no** local normalization
formula (LEAGUE-007). Live endpoint checks are behind the G-LIVE criterion
and must fail closed until real opponent/endpoint data is present. Error
model: `TooManyCountedMatches`, `DuplicateOpponent`, `DeclarationMismatch`.

## Behavioral test plan

(gate note: `G-LIVE blocks: criterion` on `pairing_preflight` — live endpoint checks wait)
- **unit (guards)** — refuse an eleventh counted match; refuse a second counted match against the same opponent; warm-up and counted modes are discrete and cannot share report state.
- **unit (declarations)** — signed prior counted-match declarations are compared and retained.
- **integration** — preflight pass/fail cases run against synthetic double data; live endpoint data required only for the G-LIVE criterion.
- **failure** — a false prior-match declaration returns the LEAGUE-004 disqualification verdict.
- **security** — hardware/version/token evidence is complete and contains no local fairness-score formula computation (LEAGUE-007).
- **determinism** — identical opponent history yields an identical eligibility verdict.

## Handoff contract

Report files changed, tests executed, exact test results, decisions made, deviations, blockers, and newly discovered work. Include command output or artifact paths sufficient for the orchestrator to validate every acceptance criterion.
