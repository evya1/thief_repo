# T051 — LLM composition, configuration, integration, and parity

## Expected outcome

One composition root parses private configuration, constructs the single Gatekeeper with a reserved
reporting lane, builds the provider, and passes it through `resolve_brain`. Disabled mode builds no
client and performs no network call. Both repositories validate a provider reply identically.

## Requirements implemented

- `STRAT-008`
- `SEC-009`
- `QR-006`
- `QR-018`

## Relevant context

Implements LLM-10 of `docs/PRD_llm_provider.md`.

This task depends on **T046 and T047 in addition to the LLM chain**: its write set shares
`src/thief_peer/runner.py` with T046 and `src/thief_peer/sdk.py` with T047. The dependency is what
serializes those shared paths; the three tasks must never run in the same wave.

`parallel_safe` is `false` for the same reason.

## Gates

- `PLANQ-003` (`decision`, `blocks: criterion`) — the disabled/template and fake-provider matrix is
  implemented and verified now; only the real-vendor configuration criterion waits.
  `{#real_vendor_configuration}`

## Constraints

- Edit only the declared write set.
- One composition function receives an already-created `CompletionClient` factory. No container, no
  service locator, no DI framework.
- CLI and SDK signatures stay compatible through defaults.
- No live external call in any test.
- Every code and test file stays below 150 logical lines.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Private configuration is parsed once into frozen `LanguageModelSettings` defaulting to
      disabled/template mode.
- [ ] Enabled mode without a registered adapter and model fails fast at startup; disabled mode builds
      no client at all.
- [ ] Exactly one Gatekeeper is constructed and the reporting lane capacity is reserved.
- [ ] The integration matrix covers disabled template mode, non-claim, fake provider success, every
      fallback class, post-move destination semantics, deadline expiry, counted-versus-warmup token
      reconciliation, and a saturated LLM lane while reporting still succeeds.
- [ ] `scripts/smoke_llm_integration.py` runs the scripted-fake scenarios through the public
      composition path and never accepts credentials or contacts a live service.
- [ ] `scripts/benchmark_hint_path.py` measures template and fake-provider/Gatekeeper overhead in a
      fresh **uninstrumented** subprocess with `perf_counter_ns`, reporting environment, sample
      count, p50, p95, and p99. It is informational, not a correctness gate, and never measures a
      real provider round trip.
- [ ] The cross-repo contract test uses the same request fixture in both repositories and expects
      semantically identical reply validation, with only package and role names differing.
- [ ] Template and non-claim modes report exactly zero tokens; unknown provider usage stays unknown
      and makes counted play ineligible while remaining explicit in warmup.
- [ ] Real-vendor configuration is verified only after `PLANQ-003` resolves.

- `uv run python scripts/smoke_llm_integration.py --scenario template --json`
- `uv run python scripts/benchmark_hint_path.py --help`
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `uv run pytest`
