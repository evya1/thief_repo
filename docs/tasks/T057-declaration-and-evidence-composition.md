# T057 — Declaration and evidence composition

## Goal

Assemble the group identity a counted declaration owes — members, repos, endpoints, hardware,
model, commit, prior counted-game count — from real sources only, and refuse counted play by
name when a required piece is missing.

## What was built

* `evidence/git_revision.py` — reads `.git/HEAD` and, when needed, `packed-refs` directly, so
  the commit that played is recorded without spawning a subprocess (App. E rule 53).
* `evidence/identity_source.py` — assembles a `GroupIdentity` from the private TOML, the real
  host, the commit reader, and the pairing history the league guard already maintains.
* `league/readiness.py::assert_counted_ready` — the composition-root gate. Checked, each named
  in its own refusal: the team code confirmation, the pre-game declaration (via
  `IdentityError`), the negotiated terms (so a config digest exists), and unknown token usage
  for any counted step.
* `wire/identity_config.py` — the App. B §4 private-TOML sections (`[game]`, `[network]`,
  `[llm]`, `[email]`), all optional so a warm-up never needs a filled-in declaration.

## Verification

```
uv run pytest tests/unit/evidence/test_git_revision.py       11 passed
uv run pytest tests/unit/league/test_counted_readiness.py    10 passed
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_private_config_identity.py      7 passed
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_declaration_completeness.py   3 passed
uv run python scripts/smoke_replay_integration.py --config config/game.json \
      --private-config config/game.toml.example --artifact-root /tmp/w2 --json
python tools/check_artifacts.py /tmp/w2/kit/<uid>            -> ALL ARTIFACT CHECKS PASS
python -m sparring.cli replay   /tmp/w2/kit/<uid> --expect-clean -> 6 verified, 0 tampered
```

## Notes

`git_revision.py` deliberately does not shell out: a subprocess would inherit the caller's
environment and working directory and could hang inside a turn budget, and reading two small
files under `.git` cannot. A test monkeypatches `subprocess.run`/`check_output`/`Popen` to raise
and asserts the reader still works, so the constraint is enforced rather than merely documented.
