# T059 — Reporting secret and live-send safety

## Goal

Align the production reporting boundary with the local official v3.0.0 book and the
machine-secret policy: use the official recipient, reuse explicit external OAuth file paths,
verify the stored token's exact send-only scope, prevent helper scripts from bypassing the
Gatekeeper, and protect variant credential/token filenames.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] The official recipient is `rmisegal+uoh26finalgame@gmail.com`; dry-run remains the default.
- [x] Live delivery remains limited to counted execution plus explicit human authorization.
- [x] The standalone helper cannot directly construct Google clients or bypass the Gatekeeper.
- [x] Stored OAuth metadata is rejected unless its scope is exactly `gmail.send`.
- [x] OAuth files are resolved through `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_FILE` and
      `GMAIL_OAUTH_TOKEN_FILE`; no secret is copied into the repository.
- [x] Variant credential/token JSON names are ignored and rejected by repository safety gates.
- [x] Tests use fakes and make no live OpenRouter or Gmail call.

## Verification

- `uv run pytest tests/unit/infra/test_gmail_oauth.py tests/integration/test_gmail_production_composition.py tests/test_repository_safety.py`
- `uv run ruff check .`
- `uv run python scripts/check_no_secrets.py`
- `uv run python scripts/run_quality_gates.py`

## Result and evidence

- Full `uv run pytest -q`: passed at 87.66% coverage.
- Full `uv run ruff check .`: passed.
- `scripts/run_quality_gates.py`: all seven generic repository gates passed.
- Deterministic two-peer smoke: `verified_ok`; the kit contains exactly 14 JSON files
  (1 declaration, 6 configs, 6 logs, 1 result) with one consistent `game_id` and `game_uid`.
- Template token evidence contains only known numeric zeroes.
- Protected local Gmail paths composed successfully and the stored token scope validated without
  constructing a Gmail client or sending a message.
- No Gmail or OpenRouter network call was made.
