"""Assemble the declarable identity from real sources, or refuse by name (T057, ADR-013).

Every value here comes from somewhere checkable: the private TOML the team filled in, the
host we are actually running on, the commit at HEAD, and our own pairing ledger. Nothing is
defaulted into existence. `GroupIdentity` does the refusing; this module's job is to gather
the inputs and to say which one is missing when it cannot.

The ledger deserves a note. `counted_games_played` is EXCLUSIVE of the series about to be
played, and it is a claim only we can make -- an opponent cannot verify it, which is exactly
why declaring it falsely is project-fatal under App. E rules 37-38 rather than merely wrong.
It is read from the pairing history that the league guard already maintains, so the number
comes from the same record that decides whether this pairing may be counted at all, rather
than from a second count that could drift from it.
