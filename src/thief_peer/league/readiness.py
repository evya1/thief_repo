"""Refusing a counted series that cannot produce the evidence it owes (T057, ADR-013).

A counted game is not undoable. Only the FIRST meeting with an opponent counts, at most ten
count in total, and a report that cannot be assembled afterwards costs the points of a series
that was actually played -- possibly the opponent's too. So the cheapest place to discover a
missing declaration is before a game exists, not in the artifact after one.

Every check names the specific thing that is missing. "Not ready for counted play" sends
someone reading log lines at 2am; "no public MCP address is declared" sends them to the one
line they have to fill in.

A warm-up refuses none of this. That asymmetry is the point: local iteration must stay cheap,
and App. E rule 52 permits unlimited uncounted games precisely so that it can be.
