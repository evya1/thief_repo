"""Project one settled series into the league kit's 14-artifact bundle (ADR-012, CT-07, T056).

Everything here reads evidence that is already sealed and writes it in a different shape. The
records go through ``league_kit_envelope.wrap_outbound_records``, which wraps the exact bytes
that were committed; the terms come from ``evidence.terms_bytes``, the sealed bytes the uid was
derived from, never a fresh projection. Nothing on this path hashes a game payload.

The self-verification below is the one place that re-hashes, and it does so AFTER writing, on
what was actually written: reload every log and reproduce every commit. It is a check on our
own serialization, not a second commitment authority -- if it ever disagrees with the seal, the
bundle is not published and the seal is right.
