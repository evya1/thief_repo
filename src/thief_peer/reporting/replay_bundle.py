"""Atomic, race-safe publication of an internal-interop replay bundle (ADR-009, RP-07).

Publication is all-or-nothing: every document is serialized in memory first (see
``replay_documents.py``), written into a unique sibling staging directory, self-verified
by reloading it and re-running ``verify_replay``, and only then renamed once into place
under an ``O_EXCL`` publication lock. Any failure -- an injected one or a real one -- leaves
no destination directory and no staging residue; a stale lock is reported, never deleted
(that deletion is exactly how the race would be reintroduced -- T022 owns recovery).

The mechanics themselves now live in ``common.transport.atomic_publish``, extracted verbatim
so the kit projection (ADR-012) reuses them instead of growing a second copy. The exception
names below are re-exported aliases: every existing caller, test and except-clause keeps
working, and there is still exactly one implementation of the sequence.
