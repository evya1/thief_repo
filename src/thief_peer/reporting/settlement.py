"""Settling a played series: agree with the opponent, then publish (T058, CT-08).

Extracted from the runner so that module stays a process entrypoint rather than a place where
protocol decisions accumulate. The ordering here is the load-bearing part: the series engine
has already run the mutual log audit (App. E rule 36 makes it a precondition of agreeing), so
by the time anything below executes, the game is verified and only the settlement remains.
