"""Scent model interface — two registered profiles behind one small common API.

There is no float maths in this module on purpose. Both registered models live in
``profiles/`` and are checked against ``vectors/pheromone.json`` and
``vectors/scent_book_v3.json``; re-deriving either here would create a second implementation
that could drift from the fixtures without anything noticing.

Two models, both selectable, because real pairings lock either one:

* ``subtractive_chebyshev_v1`` — the reference's: linear Chebyshev falloff, subtractive decay,
  rounded to 3 places, and **transmitted** on the wire. The default, because it is what
  ``wire_shape: reference-v3`` carries.
* ``multiplicative_book_v1`` — the book's own: a verbatim 5x5 figure-4 kernel, multiplicative
  decay, no rounding, once per full turn.

Note the asymmetry between the profiles: the book model's registration says ``transmitted: false`` —
each side is meant to *recompute* the rival's field rather than receive it. Running it under
``reference-v3`` therefore means "book physics, still transmitted". That is a real combination a
pair may lock, so it is allowed here and declared in the handshake rather than refused locally.
