    requires action == "STAY" and membership in barrier_targets() under quota;

    The serializable projection (action, barrier_cell as [r,c] | None, hint,
    verdict) feeds the canonical-JSON commit preimage (SPEC section 2) via C03.
    `fallback_reason` and `usage` are sealed hint-text audit metadata (T027,
    SEC-009); defaulted so the constructor stays source-compatible.
