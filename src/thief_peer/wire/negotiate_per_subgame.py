"""Per-sub-game negotiation driver (SPEC 7.2/7.3, ADR-011, T052).

`PeerFacade.run()` already sends one greeting before its six-sub-game loop
(`common/transport/series.py::_exchange_greeting`, sub_game_number=1, our
natural role -- which already equals `role_for(natural, 1)` since odd
sub-games play the natural role). That exchange *is* sub-game 1's own
handshake. This module supplies the `SubgameDriver` `PeerFacade` calls once
per sub-game so that sub-games 2 through 6 each get one more real handshake
of their own before play -- one handshake per sub-game overall, never a
second one stacked in front of sub-game 1 and never one merely before the
series.

`game_uid` declaration is PROPOSED (SPEC 7.3): the first sub-game this driver
itself negotiates (sub-game 2) omits it, since the opponent group is not yet
pinned from this driver's own point of view; sub-games 3-6 declare the
derived value once the first opponent seen here is pinned, and a declared
mismatch refuses. `role`/`sub_game_number` pairing is PROMOTED: a comparable
mismatch refuses.
