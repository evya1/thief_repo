"""Contract: a declared scent-model mismatch is refused at the handshake boundary.

T005 acceptance criterion ``{#model_lock}`` and its final criterion: the selected
scent model is registered, hashed, and *declared for the handshake*, and a declared
mismatch "refuses start with a diagnostic and no partial game state, at the handshake
boundary — never inside the scent module. A peer that declares nothing is not a
mismatch and must still play."

This is a contract test, not a unit test, because it pins the *seam* between two
modules that must never be collapsed:

* the scent module (``thief_peer.scent``) owns the pinned parameter document and its
  canonical hash (``model_lock_hash``) and states the start/refuse rule as data
  (``refusal_decision``) — but never refuses a handshake itself; and
* the transport handshake (``common.transport.negotiate.verify_greeting``) is the one
  place that turns a declared-model disagreement into a refusal (``SPAR-N05``).

The test declares the hash exactly the way a real peer would — by calling the scent
module's registry — so a drift in either the pinned document or the canonicalization
would break it, and asserts the handshake honors the scent module's own truth table
for every ours/theirs combination.
