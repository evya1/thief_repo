"""The series-wide first-opponent pin (T054).

A six-sub-game series plays exactly ONE opponent. Sub-game 1's opponent is verified by
`PeerFacade._exchange_greeting`; sub-games 2-6 are verified by the per-sub-game negotiation
driver. Before T054 each path kept its own pin, so the driver's started empty and the first
group *it* saw -- sub-game 2's -- became the pin instead of being checked against sub-game
1's. These tests drive the public composition root, not the driver in isolation, because
the defect lived precisely in how the two were wired together.

    pin, so sub-game 1's opponent was never carried forward: the first group the driver
    itself saw was sub-game 2's, and a swap there was silently adopted as the pin rather
    than refused against it.

    `group_id` is not covered by the terms signature, so rewriting it in flight is a real
    impostor an honest peer must reject -- not a synthetic mutation.

    The refusal is attributed to **A** specifically. Letting the swap through also makes
    *B* refuse later (A starts declaring a uid derived from the impostor), and counting
    that downstream refusal as success would score this defect as already fixed.
